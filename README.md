# Probability-Statstistic-Master
HOW BECOME A PROBABILITY & STATISTICS MASTER IS SET UP TO MAKE COMPLICATED MATH EASY:

This 163-lesson course includes video and text explanations of everything from Probability and Statistics, and it includes 45 quizzes (with solutions!) and an additional 8 workbooks with extra practice problems, to help you test your understanding along the way. Become a Probability & Statistics Master is organized into the following sections:

Visualizing data, including bar graphs, pie charts, Venn diagrams, histograms, and dot plots

Analyzing data, including mean, median, and mode, plus range and IQR and box-and-whisker plots

Data distributions, including mean, variance, and standard deviation, and normal distributions and z-scores

Probability, including union vs. intersection and independent and dependent events and Bayes' theorem

Discrete random variables, including binomial, Bernoulli, Poisson, and geometric random variables

Sampling, including types of studies, bias, and sampling distribution of the sample mean or sample proportion, and confidence intervals

Hypothesis testing, including inferential statistics, significance levels, type I and II errors, test statistics, and p-values

Regression, including scatterplots, correlation coefficient, the residual, coefficient of determination, RMSE, and chi-square



AND HERE'S WHAT YOU GET INSIDE OF EVERY SECTION:

Notes: The notes section of each lesson is where you find the most important things to remember. It’s like Cliff Notes for books, but for math. Everything you need to know to pass your class and nothing you don’t.

Quizzes: When you think you’ve got a good grasp on a topic within a course, you can test your knowledge by taking one of the quizzes. If you pass, great! If not, you can review the videos and notes again or ask for help in the Q&A section.

Workbooks: Want even more practice? When you've finished the section, you can review everything you've learned by working through the bonus workbook. The workbooks include tons of extra practice problems, so they're a great way to solidify what you just learned in that section.
